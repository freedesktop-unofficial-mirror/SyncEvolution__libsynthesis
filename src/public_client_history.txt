Synthesis SyncML Client for Windows Mobile and PalmOS History
=============================================================

3.1.6.10  2008-08-08  BETA PREVIEW of Synthesis SyncML Clients for PDA 3.2 (Betas have 3.1.x numbers)

                      The 3.2 release does not have visible new features, but is now based on the
                      completely revised Synthesis SyncML engine 3.2 which includes a lot of
                      compatibility, stability and error handling improvements. In particular,
                      suspend & resume has been made much more tolerant to all sorts of
                      problems that could occur depending on what server was used, and many
                      enhancements were made to prevent duplicates (such as support for UID
                      in events for Windows Mobile 5 and later devices which can support UID
                      natively).



3.0.2.23  2008-08-08  Maintainance release:

                      - PDF manual now includes a complete list of explanations for
                        possible error codes, even rare and technical ones.
                      - Better handling of case when server tries to add and already existing
                        item. With some servers, this helps to prevent duplicates.
                      - Fixed strange error code 10000 that was shown instead of
                        the real error message/code in some rare circumstances.


3.0.2.22  2008-06-17  Compatibility enhancement release:

                      - SyncML client now accepts status 418 ("already exists") during slow
                        sync and treats it like "ok" status as some servers send this status
                        instead of regular "ok" or "conflict resolved" statuses (200/201/419).
                      - Workaround for SGH-i780 which has broken (non-unique) device ID.


3.0.2.21  2008-06-16  PalmOS feature release:

                      - The "custom" fields in the PalmOS address book / contacts application
                        can now be synchronized with servers supporting X-MOZILLA-CUSTOM1..9
                        fields.

3.0.2.19  2008-05-05  PalmOS Hotfix release:

                      - Fixed problem with servers that do not support categories - this could
                        cause the Palm device to reset while adding or updating more than 15
                        device records in a row.

3.0.2.18  2008-04-09  Bugfix release

                      - Fixed bug that could cause daylight savings time shift occur at
                        the wrong date (e.g. Mexico was treated like CST/CDT, although
                        daylight savings starts earlier in CST/CDT since 2007 than in Mexico).
                      - Improved error messages when entering wrong license information
                        (better indication that problem could be a STD license entered in
                        a PRO product).

3.0.2.17  2008-04-04  Broken release - Please do not use this (harmless, but does not work)

3.0.2.16  2008-03-19  Bugfix release

                      - Windos mobile: Fixed problem with meetings having attendees without a
                        valid email address. These meetings were sometimes not stored on
                        certain WM6 devices and caused errors to be returned to the server.
                      - Windows mobile: Fixed problem with synchronizing recurring tasks from
                        server to device (recurrence was not stored, only single task).
                      - PalmOS: existing categories will no longer be reset when receiving
                        updates from a server that does not support categories.


3.0.2.15  2008-02-05  Maintainance release:

                      Windows Mobile Standard (Smartphone):
                      - Now allows entering more than 99 days before/after today for
                        date range.

                      PalmOS:
                      - Improved Autosync reliability (sometimes pending notifications
                        like SMS or calendar alarms could cause autosync to stop and
                        continue only after bringing the SyncML application to the front).
                      - Improved compatibility with Scheduleworld server (EXDATE recurrence
                        exceptions are now sent with time part matching the event's start
                        time instead of sending date only).

                      General:
                      - Fixed case where database error was reported incorrectly with
                        error code 10000.


3.0.2.13  2007-12-19  PalmOS Hotfix release:

                      - Sometimes the client returned errors when the server tried to
                        remove records that were already deleted on the client.
                        Depending on the server implementation, this could cause
                        sync to abort with error.
                      - Generally improved error handling - now returns more specific
                        error codes to server.

3.0.2.12  2007-12-07  Hotfix release:

                      - Windows Mobile: Adding exceptions for an existing recurring event
                        on the server and syncing to the device now preserves changes
                        eventually made for some instances of the recurring event.

                      - PalmOS PRO client: AutoSync reliability improved.

                      - Fix for GooSync Smartphone client: Added missing alert text
                        when trying to exit application with autosync enabled.
                      - Fix for GooSync PalmOS client: Autosync now works when
                        GooSync application is not in the foreground.


3.0.2.10  2007-09-24  Hotfix release for Windows Mobile PocketPC and Smartphone

                      - Fixed problem with DMU/Push not working with SyncWise/Toffa.


3.0.2.9   2007-09-14  Hotfix release for Windows Mobile PocketPC and Smartphone

                      - Fixed problem with certain time zones (such as Brazil or Sydney)
                        that were not recognized correctly and therefore treated as GMT/UTC,
                        causing time shifts in the calendar.

          2007-08-21  Hotfix release for PalmOS PRO clients

                      - Fixed problem with AutoSync getting suspended when autosync notification
                        was due when an another application had a notification pending and
                        the user chose to open that application (like viewing calendar
                        entry or incoming SMS).


3.0.2.8   2007-08-21  Hotfix release PalmOS clients

                      - Fixed problem with first and second postal address sometimes reverting
                        to WORK (from HOME or OTHER) when receiving changes/adds from server

          2007-07-26  Hotfix release Smartphone clients

                      - Fixed problem with constant vibration when new mail is received on certain
                        Smartphone devices (e.g. BlackJack).
                      - Fixed problem that could block the user interface after choosing "Exit"
                        from the menu.
                      - No longer shows false warning "designed for an older Windows Mobile version"
                        during installation.


3.0.2.7   2007-07-07  Hotfix release for PalmOS / Smartphone clients

                      - PalmOS: Fixed a problem that could cause the device to reset while synchronizing
                        tasks (only for Treo650 and newer, only when adding new tasks from the
                        server having no description).
                      - Smartphone PRO: Fixed problem with AutoSync settings which could not be
                        opened in 3.0.2.6 on some devices.


3.0.2.6   2007-06-27  Maintainance and Bugfix release

                      New Features:
                      - Now understands SyncML 1.1-type WBXML server alerts in addition to
                        SyncML DS 1.2 SAN.
                      - Added safety check to prevent ill-behaving servers to change any data on
                        the device if the device specifies "update server" or "reload server"
                        sync modes.
                      - Windows mobile: Enhanced provisioning - some fields in predefined settings
                        can be made read-only to prevent end users to accidentally changing them.

                      Change in behaviour:
                      - Database errors (e.g. Status 510) when storing items no longer abort the
                        datastore sync, but are simply reported as status for the item to
                        the remote party.

                      Bug Fixes:
                      - Windows Mobile 5,6: Improved detection of cradled/uncradled state.
                      - Windows Mobile: Fixed bug with recurrences - some "last-in-month" cases
                        were sent to server with wrong start date, and sometimes converted
                        from all-day to timed event.
                      - Made sure no pending maps from past sessions are sent on a non-resumed
                        slow sync, as with a slow sync, all previous maps are obsolete anyway.
                      - Windows Mobile: Added check to prevent events with neither start nor
                        end date to be saved into Pocket Outlook, but reject them with Status 415.


3.0.2.4   2007-05-10  Windows Mobile 6 compatibility and Minor Bugfix release

                      - Official release of Windows Mobile 6 support

                      - Server side change of first or last name was not shown in
                        the contacts list (but actual first+last name did change). Fixed.
                      - Only adding or changing a contact picture did not get
                        synchronized to the server (only if some other part of the
                        contact was changed also). Fixed.


3.0.2.3   2007-05-09  PalmOS Minor Bugfix release

                      - Synchronizing Memos (Notes) on some devices created error 10000.
                      - Task Completed date shown as COMPLETED now (not DTEND) in vCal.


3.0.2.2   2007-05-03  PalmOS Feature and Bugfix release

                      New Features:
                      - Added Support for Alarms and Recurrence for Tasks.

                      Important PalmOS client Bug Fixes:
                      - Fixed problem that could cause HotSync to hang sometimes
                        after using the SyncML client.
                      - Fixed problem that sometimes caused newer devices like
                        T|X or Treo 680 to crash and sometimes even enter a
                        loop of permanent restarts. Underlying cause is a problem
                        in Palm's code for legacy PIM database support.


3.0.1.2   2007-04-04  Maintainance and Bugfix release

                      New Features:
                      - Added Support for Windows Mobile 6 based devices.

                      Bug Fixes:
                      - PalmOS client: Unattended AutoSync did not work when KeyGuard
                        was enabled.
                      - PalmOS client: provisioning of AutoSync intervals now work.
                      - PalmOS client: changing private status of entry now correctly
                        causes updating it on the server.
                      - Fixed problem that could crash Palm devices under certain
                        conditions (especially Palm T|X).


3.0.0.2   2006-12-06  Bug fixes:

                      - Support for ISO8601 extended format added - needed to parse
                        vCard BDAY and REV from some servers.
                      - Fixed problem with application not starting on certain older
                        PocketPC 2003 devices without built-in phone.
                      - Fixed problem causing "No SyncML response" with certain servers
                        when using SSL/https.
                      - Fixed deleting fields from Palm Contacts.
                      - PalmOS Autosync: Autosync is now temporarily disabled during
                        voice calls as otherwise device can get unresponsive.


3.0.0.0   2006-11-24  Release of new 3.0 Version of Synthesis SyncML Clients for PDA

                      New Features:
                      - SyncML 1.2 support in addition to 1.1.2, 1.1.1 and 1.0! The Client
                        tries to contact the server with SyncML DS 1.2, and automatically
                        switches back to 1.1 or 1.0 if the server does not support 1.2.
                      - Support for true push (Server alerted notification, SAN) via
                        binary SMS for devices with built-in phone.
                      - Suspend/Resume support - with compliant DS 1.2 servers, any
                        interupted or manually aborted sync can be resumed at the point
                        where it was stopped - just by pressing the sync button again.
                      - a new menu item/taskbar button now shows a log with number of items
                        added/deleted/updated for each datastore and separately for
                        client & server, errors occurred and the amount of data bytes
                        transferred in either direction.
                      - a new menu item allows checking for updates and offers direct
                        download/install into the device (wired or wireless), as well
                        as browsing a pages showing all downloads suitable for the device.
                      - AutoSync now supported on PalmOS.
                      - Contact pictures are now fully supported on devices that
                        have them (Windows Mobile 5 and PalmOS from Treo650 onwards).
                      - Extra fields in contacts and location field in calendar found
                        in newer PalmOS devices (Treo 650 and later) now supported.
                      - PRO version can be tried for 30 days free even if already
                        tried STD version.
                      - Added Option to choose SyncML Version (in "Options")
                        for incompatible SyncML 1.x servers that cannot correctly
                        reject attempts to use SyncML 1.2. For compatible
                        servers, protocol version is selected automatically.
                      - PalmOS client: New menu item "Clean up deleted records"
                        for those that never use HotSync and want to get rid of
                        the deleted records that are retained by PalmOS because
                        they are needed for HotSync (but are otherwise useless).

                      Improvements:
                      - improved reliability with old servers that
                        don't have HTTP 1.1 keep-alive. But still,
                        keep-alive is STRONGLY recommended for
                        SyncML servers!.
                      - Better error messages for common cases like misconfigured
                        server URLs.
                      - Better sync problem handling - if server rejects some data
                        (for probably temporary reasons), session is no longer aborted,
                        but same item will be re-sent in next sync attempt.
                      - Sync log display now shows number of items
                        failed in a session with error.
                      - Much improved debug logging (DBG versions) - colored HTML
                        with hierarchic structure, which can be dynamically
                        expanded/collapsed.

                      Documentation:
                      - Completely reworked manuals, including many hints based
                        on end-user feedback since the 2.5 release.

                      Bug Fixes:
                      - PalmOS version now works with Treo 180.
                      - Workarounds for devices with broken device ID (like MotoQ).
                      - Windows Mobile client: Busy status of calendar entries is
                        now completely (all options) synchronized via vCal's TRANSP
                        property (busy=0, free=1, tentative=2, away=3).

                      Licensing:
                      - unified license codes for all PDA platforms to avoid
                        customers buying the wrong license (mainly due
                        ambiguous naming of MS Windows Mobile platforms)


2.5.0.69  2007-02-25  DEMO extension and new 3.x license compatibility release

                      - Free 30-days demo extended to work for evaluation in
                        2007 (although we recommend using the new 3.x release
                        unless specific reasons exist to continue using 2.5.x)
                      - Made fully compatible with new license mechanism introduced
                        for 3.x versions in February 2007 - 2.5.0.69 clients
                        can be used with old and new licenses without any
                        restrictions.


2.5.0.68  2006-08-31  Oracle Collaboration Suite compatibility release

                      - Generic workaround for Windows Mobile devices that do not
                        have a unique device serial number as they should.
                        This is a required upgrade only for OCS users with certain
                        devices that otherwise might not work ok with OCS.
                        However, the release works as well for any other device
                        and any other SyncML server.
                      - PalmOS version now works with Treo 180.


2.5.0.64  2006-03-03  Minor bugfix release

                      General:
                      - Sync options (like date range, size limit) now
                        are correctly combined with sync options manually
                        added to the server path field (like ./Contacts?/del(3)).
                      - vCard 3.0 now correctly escapes colons (like in
                        FN property. This has caused problems when displaying
                        the name on some systems (e.g. OCS and Outlook)
                      - Fixed bug that could cause generating empty properties
                        to servers that do not support the property at all.


2.5.0.62  2006-03-03  Minor enhancement and bugfix release

                      Windows Mobile 2003/5.0 PocketPC:
                      - Added support for square screens like Treo 700w.
                      - Fixed bug in GUI layout of German localized versions.

                      PalmOS:
                      - Fixed problem that could cause reboots under
                        certain circumstances (very many items, tight
                        memory)

                      General:
                      - Now waits longer (5 secs rather than 2) between
                        attempts to connect to the server, to give slow
                        connection establishing procedures enough time to
                        complete.2.5.0.61  2006-02-10  Minor bugfix release

                      Windows Mobile 2002, 2003, 5.0:
                      - Sending email messages with a list of recipients
                        which mixed plain email addresses with
                        name <email> type email addresses sometimes
                        did not get sent to all recipients.


2.5.0.60  2006-02-08  Minor bugfix and enhancement release

                      All PDA clients
                      - unified license codes for all PDA platforms to avoid
                        customers buying the wrong license (mainly due
                        ambiguous naming of MS Windows Mobile platforms)

                      Windows Mobile 2002, 2003, 5.0:
                      - Sending invitation emails via SyncML did not work
                        and caused "DB Error".


2.5.0.59  2006-01-31  Minor bugfix and enhancement release

                      - In Events with a large list of EXDATEs, clients
                        sometimes did not recognize all EXDATEs.

                      Windows Mobile 5.0:
                      - fixed problem with pre-configuring license information
                        via ClientConfigurator.

                      Windows Mobile 2002, 2003, 5.0:
                      - Added 2 seconds delay between connection retries to
                        give slow connections more time to establish.
                      - EXDATEs did not get sent to server in DBG versions
                        of the client (normal versions were ok)
                      - Time Transparency was not sent correctly (receiving
                        was ok).


2.5.0.54  2006-01-03  Bugfix and minor enhancement release

                      - Re-Release for extension of demo period (Previous versions did
                        not work in free demo mode after 2005-12-31).

                      PalmOS:
                      - Fixed possible problem with large number of objects (>5000).
                        Note that the maximum of objects per datastore is around 8100
                        due to PalmOS memory model restrictions.
                      - Fixed problem introduced with 2.5.0.48 which caused app to
                        fail on devices that had no settings yet (that is, on those that
                        haven't had a previous version of the Synthesis SyncML client
                        installed before.
                      - Added API to launch a SyncML synchronisation programmatically from
                        another PalmOS application.
                      - Fixed problem with non-ASCII chars in contact's email addresses.
                      - Support for Time Transparency (Busy Status) added for events.
                      - Fixed issues with allday events and recurrences that sometimes
                        lead to "Device DB error", especially on Win Mobile 5.

                      PocketPC/Smartphone:
                      - Fixed problem with with negative Pocket Outlook IDs - which
                        occur on Windows Mobile 5 only (PocketPC 2003 and 2002 were
                        not affected).

                      Windows Mobile 5.0:
                      - Added Support for Windows mobile 5 devices

                      Windows Mobile 2003 SE and 5.0:
                      - Screen rotation for landscape screen usage now supported.


2.5.0.46  2005-07-15  Minor bugfix release

                      PalmOS:
                      - Fixed problem with events recurring like "every 4th WE in the
                        Month". This did not work for days later in the month than
                        3rd MO.
                      - Reminders, recurrences and recurrence exceptions, once set,
                        could not be completely removed via SyncML.


2.5.0.45  2005-07-15  Minor bugfix release

                      PocketPC and Smartphone:
                      - Made sure that vCalendar use consistent time zone (either
                        all time information is UTC or all is localtime, but no mix).
                      - Improved updating of recurrence exceptions (un-doing a
                        previously set exception was not possible in all cases).

                      PalmOS:
                      - Fixed bug introduced with 2.5.0.33 that broke Notes sync on some
                        Palm devices. Now works again as before 2.5.0.33.


2.5.0.44  2005-07-05  Minor feature upgrade and bugfix release

                      General:
                      - Enhanced support for entering license codes - now user gets
                        opportunity to edit license details in case of typos that
                        caused the license not to be accepted in the first attempt.
                        This avoids annoying re-entering license details.
                      - Enabled support for using the same TCP connection for the
                        entire session if server supports "HTTP 1.1 keep-alive". In
                        all previous versions, the SyncML client closed and re-opened
                        the connection between requests. This enhances reliability and
                        speed on networks where opening a connection is likely to fail
                        (ActiveSync cradle connection) and/or requires a noticeable
                        amount of time.
                      - DevInf hardware version (<hwv>) now shows device hardware model name
                      - DevInf firmware version (<fwv>) now shows device OS version number
                      - No longer says "Server DB error" when in fact it is "Device DB error".
                      - Corrected problem with receiving contacts with semicolons in the
                        name or postal address.
                      - Under some circumstances, client returned status for chunked items
                        with wrong CmdRef (CmdID of the first rather than the last chunk).

                      PocketPC and Smartphone:
                      - Added check to ignore reminders timed after the start of
                        an event - as PocketOutlook cannot handle these. Before 2.5.0.35,
                        when a server sent an event with reminder after start, the
                        session aborted with Error 510.
                      - ATTENDEEs without valid email address are now assigned the
                        dummy email address "unknown@internet" as otherwise they cannot
                        be stored in Pocket Outlook.
                      - Fixed problem with servers that do update emails in the
                        inbox (e.g. to set the "read" flag). This could cause that the
                        email date was changed to a invalid date.
                      - Added support for space-saving compressed email datatype
                        "application/x-zipbin-message" v1.1 (Synthesis specific).

                      PalmOS:
                      - Set MaxMsgSize to 64000 to inform servers not to send objects
                        larger than 64000 bytes raw size (as PalmOS cannot handle them).
                      - Improved memory management to prevent problems when syncing
                        very large number of new items to some low-end Palm devices.
                      - Fixed problem that could cause hangs when server closed it's
                        side of the connection unexpectedly. Now the client detects the
                        situation and automatically re-establishes the connection and
                        re-tries the current message. This prevents sync sessions to
                        fail in case of occasional connection dropouts.


2.5.0.30  2005-04-20  Minor bugfix release

                      General:
                      - Compatibility workaround with desknow.com (Nexthaus server) added.

                      Palm:
                      - Enabled vCard 3.0 support

                      PocketPC2002:
                      - PRO Version, Autosync: Weekday selection buttons did not work
                        in PocketPC2002, replaced them by standard checkboxes.


2.5.0.27  2005-04-07  Minor bugfix release

                      Palm:
                      - Fixed bug in SSL implementation that could cause "Receiving error"
                        and on certain devices (e.g. Treo650) even sudden reboot of the
                        device when using secure https rather than plain http.


2.5.0.26  2005-03-31  Major feature release for PocketPC, PalmOS and Smartphone2003

                      Autosync (PocketPC+Smartphone2003):
                      - automatic syncing in background keeps data current all the
                        time
                      - separate sync time intervals for cradled operation (inexpensive
                        internet connection) and mobile operation (traffic is expensive)
                        configurable.
                      - other conditions for automatic sync include day-of-week and
                        time-of-day, as well as battery charging status.
                      - DirectMobileUpdate (DMU) support. With a DMU-capable server,
                        (space2go.com, toffa.com) real email push is supported -
                        automatic email sync is started whenever a new email arrives.
                        Note that this feature is only available with a DMU-enabled
                        license key.

                      Other new Features:
                      - PRO: gzip compression for receiving large data such as
                        emails with attachments - reduces expensive wireless traffic
                        by a factor up to 2 or even more.
                      - STD: now supports SSL as well (before, only PRO had SSL)
                      - Proxy support, automatically using system's proxy settings
                        in PocketPC or manually entered proxy servers.
                      - Unified naming of products in DevInf:
                        <Mod> will now shows the Client's type/variant, without version No like:

                          SySync Client <platform> <feature-set/custom version>

                        For example:

                          "SySync Client PocketPC PRO"

                      - <DevTyp> in DevInf will now shown "pda" for PalmOS and PocketPC
                        clients, and "smartphone" for SmartPhone2003 clients (rather
                        than "workstation" as before v2.5.0.22.

                      Bug Fixes:
                      - Fixed bug that caused trailing non-ASCII-chars to disappear from
                        multiline fields.
                      - Better handling of SyncML messages without correct transport
                        layer content data type (now detects WBXML coded SyncML reliably)
                      - Improved handling of connection management and all sorts of
                        errors that can cause connections to fail. Overall stability in
                        case of poor connections is much better now.
                      - Fixed memory leaks that could lead to low memory if the
                        SyncML client was being used without exiting the app for a
                        long time.
                      - bugfix for rare situation where client terminated
                        session apparently "successful" before all data was sent to
                        the server.
                      - Fixed problem that cause misinterpretations of non ASCII-chars
                        in emails.

                      Palm specifics:
                      - Added support for 5-way navigation key (e.g in Treo 600)
                      - Added Edit menu to all dialogs except About/Password.
                      - Added CATEGORIES support for AddressBook, Events and Todo
                        synchronisation.
                      - Fixed bug in email that caused incorrect display and sync
                        of "email read" flag.
                      - Improved handling of mail without date, outgoing mail
                        now receives current date as the mail's date if none is set
                        in the Mail app already.
                      - AddressBook entries without First or Last Name will no
                        longer be sent with empty N property in vCard, but
                        with Last Name set to "unnamed" to conform with vCard.
                      - Fixed problem that could occasionally make a session
                        abort with error code 403 for no apparent reason.
                      - Using phone device ID now if available in device (Treo...)
                      - Trying to add or update out-of-range (<1904 or >2031)
                        events/todos will now return a status 415 to the server
                        instead of wrapping around to a wrong date (e.g. 2037
                        became 1909).

                      PocketPC/Smartphone2003 specifics:
                      - Added "Connection Settings..." menu item to explicitly set
                        preferred connections for Cradled & Mobile operation.
                      - Added warning when two profiles use the same server account,
                        as this is likely to cause severe sync troubles.
                      - Fixed a bug that could cause deleting of emails on the
                        server under some circumstances (usually low memory)
                      - restricted number of recipients save for an email message
                        to 15, as too many recipients can mess up email storage on
                        the pocketpc.
                      - Added Notification icon that appears if email sync receives
                        new emails - Icon can be tapped to open the inbox application.
                      - Added custom logo and custom app title support for
                        re-sellers and large account. Requires customisation package
                        from Synthesis including needed tools and docs to create
                        clients with a custom logo and title.
                      - Added basic support for ATTENDEE (Name and email address
                        will be stored in Pocket Outlook Recipients list for events).

2.1.0.42  2005-01-04  Bugfix release
                      - Fixes problem that 2.1.0.3 clients do not work in demo mode
                        or with timed license key any more after 2004-12-31.
                        Permanent license keys (that is, purchased licenses) are
                        NOT affected by this bug, only free demo and evaluation.


2.1.0.4   2005-04-29  Intermediate preview release

2.1.0.3   2004-03-18  Feature upgrade release of SyncML clients for PocketPC+PalmOS
                      Initial preview release of SyncML client for Smartphone2003

                      New Features:
                      - Smartphone2003 devices now supported (only devices that
                        have no restriction for installing unsigned software)
                      - SSL support for PalmOS Version 5.2 and later.
                      - New main screen with detailed status for each data type
                        and single-tap possibility to select/deselect datastores
                        for sync.
                      - Retry mechanism added - client will now retry sending SyncML
                        messages to increase stability in case OTA connection is
                        poor and drops some messages.

                      Bug Fixes:
                      - Fixed some small recurring event problems, such as
                        parsing vCalendar data where RRULE appears before DTSTART.
                      - Reduced retries made at a server when user/password is bad.

                      Palm specifics:
                      - ALARMs for all-day events were not saved; now we
                        save them by using 0:00AM as a reference point.
                      - Support for events spanning more than a single day
                      - PalmOS: Incoming "TEL;PREF" will be now be mapped to "Main"
                        number (but only if no other TYPE attr is present).
                        Presence of "PREF" will additionally still set
                        displayPhoneForList.

                      PocketPC/Smartphone2003 specifics:
                      - Support for vCard 3.0 contact format.
                      - Support for custom sort order in contacts using FN property
                        (if supported by server)


2.0.4.4   2003-12-11  Maintainance release of SyncML clients 2.0 for PocketPC & PalmOS
                      - Official support for PocketPC2003
                      - Preview client version for SmartPhone2003

                      - PPC: Added CLASS to events and tasks (normal/private).
                      - Added new licensing mechanisms to allow issuing licenses
                        restricted to a certain server type, oem, id or URL.
                      - Added mechanism for auto-provisioning settings and license.
                      - Fixed problem in PocketPC that caused large notes for
                        events and tasks to be omitted instead of just truncated.
                      - Fixed SyncML SessionID generator, was always 0 until now.
                      - Server replaces that have a SourceLocURI will now be
                        implicitly converted to an Add if the addressed object
                        does not exist yet in the client and a corresponding Map
                        command will be generated.
                      - PalmOS client receiving timeout mechanism improved.
                      - Improved fall-back mechanism to SyncML 1.0 in case
                        server does not respond properly to the SyncML 1.1
                        session initiation. Until now, communication errors
                        could cause the client to switch back to 1.0 permanently
                        for a 1.1-capable server.
                      - Added request-resend mechanism to send
                        same request again if communication fails.
                      - Fixed bug for "text" item type that could cause email bodies
                        in MIME/multipart messages not to be recognized by the parser.
                      - Fixed bug for "text" item type that could cause emails with
                        attachments, but no body text to omit the attachments on sending.
                      - Recurrences improved such that recurrence end has the same
                        time-of-day as DTSTART or DTEND (whichever is present and later)
                      - Improved support of PocketPC exception appointment data
                        (now correctly reports renamed or shifted instances of
                        a recurrence series)
                      - Fixed problems with exotic recurrence settings on PocketPC
                        which are not compatible with vCalendar.
                      - Fixed problem with recurring events, which are defined with
                        a DTSTART that is NOT on a date where the recurrence occurs.
                        (Yes, you can enter these on PocketPC...)


2.0.1.9   2003-09-04  Maintainance release of SyncML clients 2.0 for PocketPC & PalmOS
                      - Pre-release support for PocketPC2003
                      - Fixed bug in 1.1.1-chunk reassembly.
                      - Made clients try only ONCE again after a 401 (auth failed)
                        to avoid that strict auth systems lock accounts due to
                        repeated failing login. Until now, client retried 3 times.
                      - Fixed tiny bug in RRULE parser that could cause invalid
                        database entries in PalmOS when receiving ill-formatted
                        RRULE strings.
                      - Corrected DB handling in PalmOS which could cause sorting
                        problems after deleting many records in some cases.
                      - Fixed bug in PalmOS client that could cause occasional
                        "Sending Error...".
