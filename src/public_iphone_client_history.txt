Synthesis SyncML Client for iPhone and iPod touch
=================================================

1.0.4 / 3.1.6.10  2008-08-16  Maintainance release

 - Added "Ignore SSL errors" switch to allow using
   Servers with self-signed or otherwise not fully
   verifiable or expired certificates.

 - Fixed compatibility problem with some servers
   which caused adding records to the device not to
   work (log showing "added xxx" but also "rejected xxx").

 - Fixed problem with address book entries which had
   no first name and no last name - these could cause
   the application to terminate.


1.0.1 / 3.1.6.8   2008-07-07  Initial release for App Store

 - Initial release, synchronizes address book contacts
   only because Apple does not yet allow accessing
   calendar data for third party applications.
