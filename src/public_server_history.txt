Synthesis SyncML Server History
===============================

3.2.0.11  2008-11-20  Synthesis SyncML Server 3.2 Release Candidate 2

                      Enhancements/Bug fixes:

                      - Compatibility workaround for some low-end Nokia phones (like 2630).
                      - Many refinements to work with iCalendar 2.0 data.
                      - Added script functions CONTAINS(), APPEND(), ITEMDATATYPE(),
                        ITEMTYPENAME(), ITEMTYPEVERS().
                      - Improved automatic devInf generation (avoids listing duplicate
                        fields in combined types like vCalendar with vEvent/vTodo profiles).
                      - Sample config updated to better handle some subtleties in vCalendar/vCard
                        support (separator character for CATEGORIES, etc.).
                      - Added support for ISO8601 duration values, added new script functions
                        ISDURATION(), DURATION(), POINTINTIME() to handle duration.
                      - Added <autoenddateinclusive> session and remote rule options.
                        "no" means end dates in vCalendar 1.0 (Mime-Mode old) are rendered as
                        0:00 of the first not included day. "yes" means that end dates are
                        rendered as 23:59:59 of the last day.

3.2.0.0   2008-08-28  Synthesis SyncML Server 3.2 Release Candidate 1

                      New features:

                      - Completely revised (but mostly transparent for current configs)
                        time zone handling, adding many features such as per-user
                        or per-database-field custom time zones. Existing configs need
                        to be slightly adapted only if using one of the following
                        (uncommon) script functions: LOCALIZEDASUTC, RELATIVEASUTC,
                        UTCASRELATIVE, LOCALZONEOFFSET, SETZONEOFFSET, ISRELATIVE and
                        SETRELATIVE.
                        Our sample config for the PRO servers until 3.1 used RELATIVEASUTC
                        two times – configurations based on this sample should simply
                        eliminate these calls – these are no longer needed in 3.1 onwards.
                      - Support for unicode ODBC (using <datacharset>UTF-16</datacharset>).
                      - PRO: Regular expression support in scripts (REGEX_FIND, REGEX_MATCH,
                        REGEX_SPLIT, REGEX_REPLACE).
                      - PRO: ISAVAILABLE() script function which allows generating/tuning content
                        depending on what fields are supported by the remote party.
                      - PRO: Support for relational links between items of a sync set by
                        allowing post-processing in <finalisationscript>.
                      - PRO: Scripts now support WHILE() statement.
                      - PRO: Many new script functions such as SYNCMLVERS(), EXPLODE(), ABS(),
                        SIGN(), NUMFORMAT(), DAYUNITS(), MONTHDAYS(), PARSEEMAILSPEC(),
                        MAKEEMAILSPEC(), SLEEPMS(), TIMESTAMPTODBINT(),
                        DBINTTOTIMESTAMP(), CONVERTTODATAZONE() and many more.
                      - PRO: Enhanced support for calendar content formats – new conversion
                        modes "valuetype", "tzid", "tz", "daylight", "autodate", "autoenddate",
                        new script functions to detect/generate all-day events: ALLDAYCOUNT(),
                        MAKEALLDAY() and to generate and expand recurring events:
                        RECURRENCE_DATE(), RECURRENCE_COUNT().
                      - PRO: Scripts now can use 0x1224 style hex literals.
                      - SyncML max message and object size limits are now configurable
                        using <maxmsgsize>.
                      - Enhanced debug logging: colored script source, timestamps with
                        millisecond resolution, additional block navigation links.
                      - Config variables that can be passed via command line to parametrize
                        configuration.
                      - Conditional config parsing allowing version/platform/configvar
                        dependent behaviour without modifying config file.
                      - <ignorectcap> remote rule option for clients with completely broken
                        CTCap in their device information which would cause the server to
                        suppress sending data.
                      - <dspathindevinf>/<dscgiindevinf> remote rule options for clients
                        (in particular newer Nokia devices) which need the exact datastore
                        path configured in the client (including path and CGI) to be echoed
                        in the device Information. Note that these options are on by default,
                        no extra remote rules are needed except in case another client should
                        have problems with this behaviour (none known so far).
                      - PRO ODBC: SETSETDBCONNECTSTRING() and SETDBPASSWORD() functions now allow
                        per login database selection.
                      - PRO: New recurrence rule handline functions: MAKE_RRULE() and PARSE_RRULE().
                      - <requestmintime>/REQUESTMINTIME() now allows to artificially slow down
	                  server response for testing purposes.
                      - MIME-DIR types: Added advanced conversion mode "multimix" and enum mode "prefix"
                        to handle TYPE parameters consisting of a mix of flag-type and
                        value-type components.

                      Enhancements/Bug fixes:

                      - Fixed compatibility problem with some very old SyncML 1.0 clients which
                        crash when seeing devInf with <size> and <DataType>. Now suppressing
                        these for SyncML 1.0 by default (<showtypesizeinctcap10> not set).
                      - More tolerance with status 418 received from remote.
                      - PRO: Integer field now properly differentiates between value 0 and "empty".
                      - <afterconnectscript> now has it's own private script context, as it
                        can implicitly be called from other scripts - in case of login context
                        script this caused unpredictable behaviour.
                      - Many general bug fixes and stability enhancements.
                      - Many workarounds and improvements added to make server more
                        tolerant to implementation flaws in foreign clients.



3.0.3.6   2008-04-10  Maintainance Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      - Corrected problem that caused Status 415 when client sent
                        Soft-Delete and Archive-Delete commands (as some LG handsets do).
                      - Corrected problem with Mexican time zone which was falsely
                        recognized as CDT/CST.
                      - Fixed memory leak caused by timed-out sessions in multithreaded
                        server environments.

                      - Added support for Apache 2.0 on Mac OS X Leopard

3.0.3.4   2007-11-07  Hotfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      - Corrected bug that could cause sessions to abort with Error 403
                        under some circumstances, especially with slow sync set loading.
                      - System time zone detection improved (failed sometimes in certain
                        Australian and Brazil zones).
                      - Device full status received from client (420) is now considered
                        a non-fatal error and counted as such in the session statistic.
                        Before that, device full just caused no more data to be sent,
                        but had no visible indication in the sync statistics.
                      - Fixed problem with scripts when first element in <fieldmap> was
                        an <array> (and not a <map> as usually the case).

3.0.3.2   2007-08-16  Feature and Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      New features:

                      - Adjustments for Nokia E90 Communicator to correctly transfer
                        contacts tel numbers, postal addresses and contact photo.
                        Remote rule for E90 added to sample config.

                      - Support for SQLite as alternative to ODBC datastore added (not
                        available in all server products at this time).

                      Bugfixes:

                      - When fetching BLOB or string columns with exact size of 512+n*65536,
                        sometimes a DB error occurred.
                      - Apache based servers licensed with only one concurrent connection
                        always reported Server Busy status.


3.0.2.2   2007-06-14  Feature and Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      New features:

                      - Sample configuration updated to support P990/M600i email format
                        (message/rfc822) and updated remote rules.
                      - Added datastore-wide <deletewins> config option.
                      - Added <tryupdatedeleted> datastore option: With this option set,
                        and a conflict between a server delete and client update happening,
                        the server will try to update the item (even though it is not
                        visible in the syncset any more). This can be useful to prevent
                        duplicates in filtered (e.g. date range) sync sets.
                      - ODBC: now using SQLRowCount() ODBC function when doing modifications
                        to the DB to detect when record for UPDATE or DELETE was not found.
                        Added <ignoreaffectedcount> to disable this check (for example in case
                        statement is a stored procedure call which does not update the row count).

                      Change in behaviour:

                      - Database errors (e.g. Status 510) when storing items no longer abort the
                        datastore sync, but are simply reported as status for the item to
                        the remote party. To still force aborting sync in such cases, use
                        <receiveditemstatusscript>s in datastore or session.

                      Bugfixes:

                      - Fixed (another) map handling problem that could cause invalid (but
                        harmless) delete commands to be sent to clients. This happened
                        only for clients with small MaxGUID size (<9).
                      - Linux install2.sh script fixed to work with Debian Etch.


3.0.2.0   2007-05-11  Feature and Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      New features:

                      - Added possibility to define device-specific data types, using the
                        new "rulematch" attribute in the <typesupport><use> config. This allows
                        for manufacturer or model specific mapping of content fields.

                      - Apache versions (Linux, Mac OS X) can now run multiple sessions as
                        threads within one single process. This mode is more efficient
                        for server installations using Java plugins or other technology
                        which has a large per-process memory footprint or initialisation
                        overhead. Without additional configuration, the server runs in
                        one-process-per-session mode as before. To configure threaded modes,
                        use the new <maxthreads> and <maxsessionruns> config options in
                        the new <transport type="pipe"> section. Note that mod_sysync/mod_sysync2
                        must be updated as well to take advantage of threaded modes.
                        However, pre-3.0.2 mod_sysync works in non-threaded mode with >=3.0.2
                        server and vice versa.

                      - Support for unicode content in datatypes (like Nokia's VMSG) with
                        new <unicodedata> and <bigendian> config options.

                      Bugfixes:

                      - When using filters on syncset, sometimes the server could create
                        invalid (but harmless) delete commands.
                      - Fixed problems with clients that send garbage after the SyncML message
                        itself (now ignored).
                      - Fixed map handling problem that could cause invalid (but harmless)
                        delete commands to be sent to clients.
                      - script debug logging is now collapsed by default.


3.0.0.17  2007-02-28  Minor Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      - Fixed problems with <array> map in Linux versions.
                      - Fixed problem reading data from <array> map having a keyfield attribute.
                      - Fixed problem with %V substitution in SQL updating all fields instead of
                        only assigned ones.


3.0.0.14  2007-02-28  Minor Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      - Fixed problems with detecting correct timezone on some Linux
                        systems, added new 2007 DST timezone info.
                      - Fixed problems in scripting with variables defined multiple
                        times in different scripts (but same script context).


3.0.0.8   2007-02-13  Minor Bugfix Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      - DBApi - improved threading management. In some occasions, problems
                        could occur with <multithread> on, especially with JAVA plugins.
                      - DBApi JAVA module class may now be placed within a package (before,
                        it had to be at the classpath root level).
                      - Fixed bug that caused SEGV with the DEMO server on some Linux systems.
                      - Minor improvements in debug logging.


3.0.0.2   2006-12-14  Official Release of Synthesis SyncML Server 3.0

                      Most important new Features:

                      - SyncML DS 1.2 / OMA DS 1.2 support in addition to 1.1.2, 1.1.1 and 1.0!
                        Existing config of 2.1.x version servers can be used without
                        changes - and only minimal changes are required to enable suspend/resume.
                      - Full Suspend/Resume support including resuming partially transmitted
                        large objects.

                      - New Hierarchically structured, dynamically foldable, nicely colored
                        HTML logs by default, text or xml format selectable.
                      - Log output from subthreads can now be either suppressed or logged
                        into a separate log file configurable via <subthreadmode>.

                      - PRO server includes plugin API for custom database adaptor plugins written
                        in C/C++ or Java using the Synthesis Database Plugin SDK.
                      - Demo Server now based on new Database Plugin technology.

                      - Support for B64 encoded binary data, e.g. PHOTO in vCard. New
                        config sample includes support for contact photos.
                      - ODBC now supports on-demand reading of large fields (such as the
                        PHOTO in contacts, or attachment CONTENTS in emails, see sample config)
                        which is a major efficiency improvement.

                      - Support for DS 1.2 <filter>, including automatic indication in
                        <devinf>. Full record level filtering is supported (inclusive
                        and exclusive mode), but no field level filtering yet.
                        Support must be switched on with <daterangesupport> and <ds12filter>
                        config tags on a per datastore level.
                      - DS 1.1 style CGI filters (/fi() and /tf()) now also support the
                        complete DS 1.2 filter syntax, with enhanced case insensitive
                        comparison and access to individual elements of multivalues
                        (like N[1]=last name, N[2]=first name in vCard).

                      - Added full support for DS 1.2 MaxOccur/MaxSize/NoTruncate
                        mechanisms (fully automatically generated devInf).
                      - Support for ISO8601 extended format added - needed to parse
                        vCard BDAY and REV from some clients.
                      - All config tags now support "platform=xxx" attribute (xxx can
                        be "win32", "linux" or "macosx" at this time). This allows to
                        have variants for different platforms (e.g. log paths) in
                        a single config file.
                      - New <afterconnectscript> for SQL databases that need a per-connection
                        login statement (like SyBase).
                      - Enhanced content type detection in cases where HTTP Content-Type
                        header was wrong or missing in incoming SyncML traffic.

                      Important Changes:

                      - Adds, Replaces and Deletes that receive a non-ok status from the client
                        no longer abort the session by default, but are simply flagged for
                        resend in the next session. <resendfailing> can be used to get
                        the old behaviour back, SETRESEND() allows dynamic decision if
                        resend or session abort is needed on a per item basis.
                      - Global log now off by default
                      - Each Chunk of Large Objects (<moredata/> mechanism) now contains
                        a <meta><EMI>datapos=x element to indicate the beginning
                        byte position of the chunk. This is required (but missing in the
                        SyncML DS 1.2 standard so far) for proper resume after implicit
                        suspends (connection break).
                      - WBXML generation: SyncML 1.1 and 1.2 now use space-saving numeric
                        FPI (Formal Public Identifier) in WBXML instead of textual DTD string.
                      - <initscript> in <array> is now executed before detail records
                        are deleted, so returning false will now prevent any change in
                        the detail records.


2.1.1.28  2006-03-31  Minor bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      Enhancements:
                      - New "show" attribute for <parameter> allows showing parameters
                        (and their <enum> values, if any) in devInf. This e.g. solves
                        problems with some phones that would only send a single
                        TEL number if they do not get the list of possible TEL
                        number types (CELL, HOME, WORK...), such as Nokia 7610.

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Corrected some problems with writing and reading BLOBs and
                        parametrized INSERT or UPDATE values.
                      - All %xx substitutions now use <datacharset>, <datalineends>
                        and <quotingmode> settings to correctly format and quote
                        strings
                      - Servers set up storing MD5 hashes for user auth sometimes did
                        not allow clients to use basic-auth any more, which is usually
                        needed for old SyncML 1.0 clients only. All MD5 auth
                        was ok, so SyncML 1.1 clients were not affected.
                        Servers storing passwords (not MD5 hashes), like the sample
                        config delivered with the server, were not affected.
                        This is now fixed.
                      - Yearly re-release of DEMO servers to extend demo period until
                        end of 2006

                      Changes:
                      - <initscript> in <array> is now executed before detail records
                        are deleted, so returning false will now prevent any change in
                        the detail records. 2.1.1.19  2006-01-18  Minor bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:


2.1.1.18  2005-09-13  Minor bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Windows: Fixed bugs that could cause an AV in the server when a session
                        terminated unsuccessfully or needed to be aborted due to a
                        session timeout.
                      - Linux: Better cleanup - failing sessions sometimes left unused pipes
                        and files in the pipe directory which could cause false "server busy"
                        conditions.


2.1.1.12  2005-07-19  Minor enhancement and bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      Enhancements:
                      - Added SIZE() script function to measure size of an array (LENGTH
                        is not suitable for arrays).

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Fixed bug in typecasting in scripts - did not work when directly
                        casting a variable or field reference (it worked with expressions).
                      - Fixed bug with session timeout introduced with 2.1.1.9 - depending
                        on time zone, sessions could immediately time out after start.


2.1.1.9   2005-07-07  Minor enhancement and bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      Enhancements:
                      - xpt (standalone) server now supports HTTP 1.1 keep-alive, it is
                        configurable with <keepconnection>.
                      - PRO only: <localidscript> in ODBC datastore now allows using a
                        script for generating local IDs (rather than using an SQL statement).
                      - High-efficiency data format option (<zippedbindata>, <zipcompressionlevel>)
                        with built-in gzip compression added. This can be used in situations
                        where both client and server can be configured to understand this format
                        or with certain PDA clients from Synthesis AG which have built-in
                        support for it for large emails (application/x-zipbin-message).
                      - Added <quotingmode> to ODBC <server> and <datastore> to control how string
                        literals are quoted. Needed for MySQL which treats backslash as
                        escape char (C-style).
                      - Added sync start time, end time and duration information for use in
                        logs (%ssT, %seT, %sdT).

                      Bugfixes:
                      - RRULE enddates were not always parsed and displayed correctly (sometimes
                        a time shift related to the time zone was added).
                      - Corrected docs: <map> attribute is called "set_no", not "setno".
                      - "%av" sequence in SQL statements had to be written as "%av(" due to a
                        bug in the definition table (the extra paranthesis).
                      - Under some circumstances, server returned status for chunked items
                        with wrong CmdRef (CmdID of the first rather than the last chunk).


2.1.1.2   2005-04-13  Minor bugfix release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Fixed bug that could cause (apparently only with Win 2003 server)
                        sessions to abort with "receiving error" for no apparent reason.


2.1.1.0   2005-03-07  Maintainance Release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      New Features:
                      - Added <treatasutc> option for <remoterules> and TREATASUTC()
                        script function to allow handling a bug in Nokia S80 (9500/9300)
                        devices which send time values in UTC, but format them as if
                        it was localtime, which shifts time in calendar when syncing
                        from a device to a server.
                      - Added new remoterules to the standard remote rule set for
                        Nokia 9500 and 9300.

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Fixed bug in content-type detection in case HTTP headers do
                        not contain correct content type.
                      - Fixed performance eating problem in text-based datatypes
                        with really large objects (such as multi-Meg email attachments).
                      - Fixed bug in LargeObject generation: Sometimes, a new
                        command was issued while the previous command's data was not
                        completely sent; this caused Error 223 at the receiving end.
                      - Fixed bug that did not show ODBC error when inserted into
                        log table failed (only showed "exception").
                      - Fixed bug that could cause Add/Replace/Delete being sent in
                        the wrong <sync> command context in some (very rare) cases.
                      - Fixed bug that could abort the session when decoding WBXML
                        documents that contained content consisting of more than one
                        single WBXML string (or string table reference).


2.1.0.1   2005-01-06  Feature Upgrade and Maintainance Release of Synthesis SyncML Server:

                      New features:
                      - Enhanced Filter Architecture, now supporting SyncML-Standard
                        TAF-Style filters in addition to our own dynamic and static
                        SyncSet limiting filters, even in combination.
                        Added support for TAF generic field names in vCard like
                        "GIVEN" and "FAMILY", and for vCalendar "START" and "END".
                        Allowed using property names in filters for MimeDIR and
                        tagged header names for TextItems. Filters can also
                        refer to "LUID" and "REMOTEID".
                        New <optionfilterscript> and SETSQLFILTER() to allow
                        an ODBC datastore to create a custom SQL filter expression from
                        STARTDATE() and ENDDATE(). Also added DBLITERAL() function to
                        create DB literals when assembling SQL statements in scripts.
                      - Added support for issuing SQL statements programmatically in
                        scripts (SQLEXECUTE() etc.).
                      - SHELLEXECUTE() script function now allows calling external
                        programs from within a sync session.
                      - Remoterules can now cause execution of a <rulescript>.
                      - Remoterules now use wildcard matching for checking manufacturer,
                        model and oem (so one rule can match multiple similar devices for example).
                      - MIME-DIR <property> definitions can now made dependent on
                        the currently active remote rule. This allows device-dependent
                        interpretation of vCards/vCals which can be useful for difficult
                        devices.
                      - Support for ODBC parameters, allows for calling stored
                        procedures with in/out/inout params for example for Oracle.
                      - Added RFC2047 generator/parser to correctly handle non ASCII
                        special chars in email header fields.
                      - Added support for vCalendar 2.0-style RRULE syntax.
                      - scripting: Added SETxxxxx functions for DB options
                        like date range, item max count, limit, noattachments.
                      - scripting: <logininitscript> now can return NOTHING
                        (meaning no auth decision made), TRUE (auth ok, no
                        further checking needed) or FALSE (auth not ok, no
                        further checking needed)
                      - Added SETCONFLICTSTRATEGY to set conflict strategy
                        in datastoreinitscript according to user settings or
                        other run-time conditions.
                      - Datastore initialisation and loading of the sync set
                        can now take place in a background thread while communication
                        with the client is kept active.
                        This is useful with clients that have a short timeout (e.g. 30
                        seconds) and slow databases or very large sync sets that take
                        more time than the client's timeout. Added <requestmaxtime>
                        and <multithread> to control threading behaviour and timing.
                      - One-way-from-client sync mode now supported in ODBC datastores.
                        Requires updated SYNC_TARGETS table as we need to store the
                        date of last sync when data was transmitted to the remote in
                        addition to the last sync date (<fromremoteonlysupport>).
                      - Better handling of SyncML messages without correct transport
                        layer content data type (now detects WBXML coded SyncML reliably)
                      - Support for simplified chinese charset (GB2312/CP936)
                      - Debug logs now show all SyncML Command references in a unified
                        format such that e.g. searching a command's status response is
                        easy (copy command ref into edito's search command).
                      - Added per-datastore and per-session data byte counting,
                        can be saved in log file / table with new %diB/%doB/%tiB/%toB sequences.
                      - Elements of array fields are now shown in logfiles when
                        internal fields are dumped.
                      - added <acceptserveralerted> config flag to session
                        to allow the 206..210 alert codes (but with no
                        functional difference to 200..205)
                      - Added <loginfinishscript>
                      - Added <finishscript> to ODBC datastores (here we can execute SQL if needed)
                      - Added <datastorefinishscript> to all datastores
                      - Added <finishscript> on session level
                      - Unified naming of products in DevInf:
                        <Mod> will now shows the Servers type/variant, without version No like:

                          SySync server <platform> <server-type> <database> <feature-set>

				For example:

                          "SySync Server Win32 ISAPI ODBC PRO",

                      - Unified and updated remoterules in all sample server configs
                        to contain the currently known (big) list of device exceptions.
                        Updates to the remoterules list can be obtained from our
                        website at www.synthesis.ch.
                      - Added support for processing and generating custome GET and PUT
                        SyncML commands (<customendputscript>, ISSUEPUT() and ISSUEGET()).
                      - Licensing: For OEMs, it is now possible to lock sections of
                        the config and bind it to a certain license. This prevents
                        unauthorized modifications of critical config sections by the
                        end user.

                      Bugfixes:
                      - Fixed bug in script engine, it was not possible to
                        declare arrays as local variables.
                      - Default charset is now UTF-8 when parsing MIME-DIR formats (e.g.
                        vCard 3.0, but not vCard 2.1, where default is still ANSI)
                      - Improved algorithm to find Tx type such that it will
                        now use remote's preferred Rx (first priority) or local's
                        preferred Tx (second priority) or just a match (third priority)
                      - Fixed some potential dead-lock problems with ISAPI server
                        and clients that do retry sending a message.
                      - Fixed bug in "valueseparator" feature (did not work if separator
                        was not a semicolon).
                      - Fixed small bug in vcalendaritemtype parser which would have
                        caused problems with rarely used RRULEs like "MD1 1- #10".
                      - Fixed bug in SESSIONVAR() script function: did abort the
                        script when variable did not exist, now returns UNASSIGNED.
                      - Fixed bug that could cause SyncML 1.0 sessions to terminate when a
                        data item was bigger than what could fit into a message. This
                        could happen especially with clients with very small message
                        sizes (<3k) like SonyEricsson T610 and large vCard NOTES for example.
                      - Fixed bug that caused trailing non-ASCII-chars to disappear from
                        multiline fields.
                      - Fixed bug in email body processing which could cause body to
                        be parsed as empty.
                      - Fixed SyncML 1.1 problem when client does not send MaxObjSize. In
                        this case, the server assumed maxobjsize=0 which prevented any
                        big object to be sent at all.


2.0.5.1  2004-01-28   Maintainance Release of SyncML Server 2.0:
                      - Some Script functions where not available from ODBC-datastore
                        scripts.
                      - Possible crash at startup on machines that do not have a TCP/IP
                        host name (gethostent() returns nothing) fixed.
                      - Enhanced datastore name matching for cases where remote
                        datastores have names that only differ in path elements.
                      - Enhanced MIME-DIR parser with "delayedparsing" attribute in
                        <property> to allow parsing vCals that have RRULE before
                        DTSTART (but DTSTART is required for parsing RRULE).
                      - added "delayedparsing=1" to RRULE in all sample config files
                      - sample config: replaced "JOIN x ON y" syntax in <folderkeysql> with
                        more compatible implicit join (link expressions in WHERE)
                        as for example MySQL 3.23 does not support "JOIN x ON y".
                      - Fixed bugs that could cause exceptions when <position> was
                        used with repeat="array".
                      - Fixed various small bugs with processing of ODBC <array> mappings
                      - improved ODBC <array> mappings to allow a "sizefrom"
                        field to determine the number of detail records to write.
                      - First Linux version (preview)


2.0.4.4   2003-12-11  Maintainance Release of SyncML Server 2.0:
                      - Fixed bug in comparison of "multiline" fields in scripts
                        (compare now works with > and < (string ordering)).
                      - Added <dbconnectionstring> to allow more parameter to
                        be passed for ODBC connection (e.g needed for MySQL)
                      - Fixed bug in parsing of RFC822 dates (emails)
                      - Added "default" and chained remoterule checking with
                        new "finalrule" tag.
                      - Fixed bug that prevented filtering (/fi()) for the KIND
                        field to differentiate vEvent/vTodo.
                      - Fixed bug in filter processing: SyncML TAF-style (&and;...)
                        now works correctly.
                      - added <datastoreinitscript> and new functions
                        to add filter expressions to targetfilter and localdbfilter
                        in runtime (ADDFILTER, ADDSTATICFILTER, GETFILTER, SETFILTER).
                      - added /o() CGI option and DBOPTIONS() function
                        for <datastoreinitscript>
                      - added /slow CGI option to force slowsync
                        from clients that have no GUI for that.
                      - improved logging of session-related problems like WBXML/XML
                        parsing errors (now appear in session log and not only in
                        global log)
                      - fixed bug in ISO8601 parsing that could cause mis-interpretation
                        of non-UTC time in rare cases.
                      - Added server config <maxguidsizesent> to add an implicit GUID
                        limit to prevent troubles with dumb clients that do not specify
                        a limit but seem to crash on very long IDs.
                      - Added <configidstring> to help identifying config used for
                        each session in session logs.
                      - Added display of request processing time to debug logs.
                      - Added last-answer-buffer mechanism and resend-answer-if-request-repeated.
                        ISAPI server has now a <bufferretryanswer> in <transport>
                        to disable buffering.
                      - Fixed bug for "text" item type that could cause email bodies
                        in MIME/multipart messages not to be recognized by the parser.
                      - Fixed bug for "text" item type that could cause emails with
                        attachments, but no body text to omit the attachments on sending.
                      - NORMALIZED() script function returned EMPTY for UNASSIGNED
                        input; Now it returns UNASSIGNED in this case.
